BPNT Helper is a desktop application that helps the BPNT agents in carrying out the buying and selling process. It resembles POS (Point-of-Sale) system, but stripped down--adjusted to meet the simpler requirements. Written in JavaScript and built with Electron and NeDB, all of which run locally. For the time being, user interface is hardcoded into Bahasa Indonesia.
